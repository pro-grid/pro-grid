### branching
Please do not commit directly to master.
 - make an issue describing what you are going to do
 - create a branch `git checkout -b fixYOUR_ISSUE_NUMBER`
 - when done submit a pull request for code review and testing

### modifying web.js
If you would like to make improvements to web.js (the node server componenet), we are trying to minimize the amount of synchronous code. Please consider writing in an asynchronous style when modifying web.js.
